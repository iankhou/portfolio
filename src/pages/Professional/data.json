Working with this team has brought me mentorship beyond any other professional experience and encouraged me to further pursue applied machine learning.",

Working at the Lab has been a transformative experience for me, as it's where I learned a large portion of my knowledge in application development. The range of projects I've worked on there include an interactive site to educate communities about email phishing, a stock market simulator with AI-generated data, and a groundbreaking app to track and identify undiagnosed illnesses. Working there has given me opportunities to work on projects that have social impacts beyond the Lab.",

Between finding purpose in serving my local and national community and meeting soldiers from all walks of life, my experience in the Army has been eye-opening and deeply satisfying. I served as an intelligence analyst from 2017 to 2019. I am now a cadet in Dartmouth ROTC and will commission into the Army Reserve as an officer in 2022.",
