My first task was to solve this problem by any means possible. I started off automating listing updates from those third party sellers, using Selenium scripts running on a Google Cloud server. Beyond that, I helped to increase brand awareness by creating automatic listing uploads to Google Merchant Center, where we could advertise our products. Working for Alex made me constantly think on my feet for innovative and unconventional solutions.",

Adding integration and calendar data has only made the pipeline more accurate, and I am currently working toward automatic predictions for our users 24/7.
